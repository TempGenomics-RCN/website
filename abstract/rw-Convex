This talk will introduce the basics for Convex Optimization, several popular
optimization algorithms, and the application for convex optimization in Machine
Learning.

## Outline

- Introduction(definition of Affine, Convex Sets, Convex functions, Conic
  Combinations, Convex Cones, and Convex Hulls)
    - The main focus will be on Affine, Convex functions, Convex and Conic
      hulls. 
- Extreme points
- Subdifferentials
- Convex Minimization + Maximization
- Applications: 
    - Perceptron
    - Gradient Descent
        - How it is used in Machine Learning algorithms
