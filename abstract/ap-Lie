In 1870, Sophus Lie was studying the symmetries of differential equations,
which generally form “continuous” groups. The analogous problem for polynomials
was solved by Galois previously, so there was incentive to solve the related
problem for these new kinds of groups. We’ll motivate such continuous groups by
looking at matrices, assuming only a little linear algebra.

Lie started a study of simplicity in these continuous groups. Lie understood
these groups as groups generated by infinitesimal elements, which led him to
believe that a group ``G`` should be generalised to consider infinitesimal
elements. 

Today we separate the infinitesimal elements of a group ``G`` to form a Lie
algebra ``g``, which captures most of the important structures of ``G``, but is
easier to handle. This talk will focus on motivating Lie's definitions, and
provide some techniques used to prove simplicity for Lie groups. As well, some
specific examples such as ``\mathrm{O}(n)``, ``\mathrm{SO}(n)``,
``\mathrm{U}(n)``, ``\mathrm{SU}(n)``, and ``\mathrm{Sp}(n)`` will be mentioned
to illustrate the concepts presented.
