I will try to provide a brief introduction to Information Theory working
towards motivating Shannon's Source Coding Theorem. We will use rather simple
examples (for e.g. Repetition Codes) to explain the idea of noisy channels and 
similarly simple examples to explain the idea behind the theorem and 
eventually try to prove it for a rather specific example. (if we have the time !)
