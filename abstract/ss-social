Social choice functions help aggregate the opinions of many agents. Social choice problems
arise in examples as varied as citizens voting in an election, committees deciding on
alternatives, and independent computational agents making collective decisions. We aim to
study social choice theory through the lens of boolean functions, and study concepts such as
influence and noise stability, which provide analogues for natural concepts in the study of
social choice. We will finish off by looking at the famous Arrow’s Theorem often popularly
stated as “the only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship”.
