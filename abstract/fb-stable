I will introduce the Stable Marriage Problem, and its NP-complete cousin, the Stable
Marriage Problem with ties. I will present a simplified version of Király’s
3/2-approximation algorithm, which archieves the best approximation ratio known.

The [slides for this presentation](/assets/stable-marriage-approximation.pdf) are available.
