From the graph of Facebook friendships to the neurons inside your brain,
networks are all around us. We’ll go over some surprising *connections* in
network theory and see some of the following:

## Outline

- Random graphs
  - Phase transitions of the Erdos-Renyi random graph, and emergence of the
    so-called “giant” component 
  - If time permits, discovering that the uniqueness of this component
    approaches probability of ``\frac{5\pi}{18}``
  - The Rado graph and its connection to first order logic on graphs
- Spectral theory of general undirected graphs
  - What the eigenvalues of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices say about the
    properties of a graph
  - Connections to computer vision and dimensionality reduction
