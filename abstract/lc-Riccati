In 1841, 3 years before Joseph Liouville discovered transcendental numbers,
Joseph Liouville showed that the Riccati equation ``y' = ay^2 + bx^m`` has a
quadrature solution if and only if ``m = 0, -2, -\frac{4n}{2nÂ±1}``. Nowadays,
we see Liouville's results as the foundation to qualitative analysis to
differential equations, a fascinating subarea of DEs, which studies for example
the existence and uniqueness of different kinds of equations. In my talk, I
will (hopefully) prove the classical result of Liouville after a quick review
of history and related linear theory.
