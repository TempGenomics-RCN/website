## Outline

- What is supervised machine learning? 
- What is the reinforcement learning problem?
- Examples:
    Deepmind Atari, 
    Alpha GO, 
    TD Gammon 
- Basic Q Learning interactive intuition based on human brain 
- Formalizing Q Learning 
- Lets set up a problem 
- Scaling Q Learning interactive intuition 
- Improvements (if we get this far)
   Double Q Intuition, 
   Experience Replay, 
   Frozen Model, 
   Prioritized Replay
