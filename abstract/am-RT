In 1844, Joseph Liouville discovered transcendental numbers — those numbers
that are not roots of polynomials with rational coefficients. Nowadays, we see
Liouville’s discovery as the foundation of Diophantine approximation, a
fascinating subarea of number theory, which studies how well algebraic numbers
can be approximated by the rationals. In my talk, I will prove the classical
result of Liouville and explain further advances in the area, such as Thue’s
theorem and the celebrated theorem of Roth, which enabled its discoverer to
receive the Fields medal in 1958.
