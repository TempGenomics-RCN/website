In this talk, we try to understand how to reason about quantum algorithms. We assume minimal linear algebra (first few weeks of math 136 should be fine) and try to understand how we can do computations enabling quantum computation using only manipulations of matrices. I intend to make the talk accessible to EVERYONE therefore we will make sure to mention all the linear algebra required. We hope to build up towards presenting a popular quantum algorithm using elementary tools focussing on intuition rather than rigor.
