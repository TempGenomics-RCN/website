In this talk, we’ll study graphs which are “sparse” yet “highly connected”. Known as
expanders, these graphs exhibit interesting properties which can be viewed from a rich array
of analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic perspectives. Contributions of expanders range
from the proof of important results in complexity theory to derandomization of algorithms to
the construction of robust networks and cryptographic hash functions. We’ll see one
application to coding theory, where expanders can be used to provide asymptotically “good”
error-correcting codes with linear time encoding and decoding.

Prerequisites: linear algebra (familiarity with eigenvalues and eigenvectors).
