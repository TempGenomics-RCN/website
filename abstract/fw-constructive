Constructive mathematics, as the name would suggest, is centered on the philosophy that
mathematical proofs should be able to be turned into algorithms. We will contextualize
constructive approaches to analysis, roughly following Bridges and Vîţă. This talk has no
formal prerequisites beyond an elementary understanding of the real numbers and the usual
concept of completeness. In particular, no logical background is assumed; intuitionistic
logic will be overviewed in the talk. We will finish with a discussion of the ramifications
of completeness of the real numbers.
