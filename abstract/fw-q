Some of the most interesting results in combinatorics are generalizations of
simple problems or theorems to problems or theorems parameterized by a
parameter ``q`` (often complex-valued). By taking the limit as ``q\to1``, the
simple problems can be recovered. Surprisingly, many of these ``q``-analogs
take similar forms, and are seen across a wide variety of problems that may
initially seem unrelated.

Concepts from MATH 239 will be used. It is heavily recommended that people who
have not taken MATH 239 or an equivalent course read some [material on ordinary
generating functions](/document/ordinary-generating-functions).
