Almost 200 years after Évariste Galois's death, there is still one question
about Galois groups — the symmetries of the roots of polynomials, that still
remains unsolved. This is the Inverse Galois Problem — whether every group is a
Galois group of a Galois extension of the rational numbers. In this talk, I
will give an overview of the progress that has been made, the approaches that
mathematicians are making, and directions for further research.

A note on the requirements for this talk: It is recommended that you be
comfortable with groups, fields, field extensions, automorphisms, and basic
Galois theory. This requirement can be met by any of the following suggested
alternatives:

 - having taken PMATH 347, and currently taking PMATH 348;
 - having taken PMATH 347, and coming for the prerequisite knowledge
   presentation (see below);
 - having equivalent knowledge to PMATH 347 and PMATH 348;
 - otherwise, if you are currently taking or have taken MATH 146, this talk is
   still accessible, but it is highly recommended that you read [An
   Introduction to Galois Theory](https://nrich.maths.org/1422) by Dan Goodman,
   and watch [this 18-minute
   lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8__4fzMmsM) by Matthew Salomone
   (after reading the article) and optionally also come for the prerequisite
   knowledge presentation

A prerequisite knowledge presentation about Galois theory will be given at
17:00, prior to the beginning of the talk at 17:30. This presentation will last
about 20 minutes. If you are unfamiliar with the material, it is recommended
that you read some of the linked material above in addition to attending this
presentation. Attending this presentation is optional. The reference material
used for this presentation is the [Galois Theory](/document/galois-theory/)
document.
