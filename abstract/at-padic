In this talk we will discover an alternate way to define the "size" of a ration
al number. We will define the p-adic absolute value and see that this absolute 
value is Non-archimedean and that this fact leads to a a geometry that is very 
different from the geometry of the Real numbers (every p-adic triangle is isosc
eles!). In addition I will show you some fun ideas from p-adic numbers (which I
will denote by ``\mathbb{Q}_p`` like the fact that ``\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 3^n`` 
converges and how every element of ``\mathbb{Q}_p`` has a base ``p`` expansion.
This is meant to be a very leisurely talk with almost no prerequisites and it 
should be fun so please come for it!
