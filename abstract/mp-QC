Introduction to quantum computing. We start off by tackling a classical problem
via deterministic and probabilistic computation and then motivate a quantum
model of computation. Along the way we lay out some of the mathematics needed
to describe quantum computation and how it corresponds to key concepts in
quantum mechanics such as interference and superposition.
