This talk will begin with a brief overview behind the theory of words in mathematics as well
as the theory of finite automata in theoretical computer science. After this, we will define
what an automatic sequence is, prove some fundamental theorems about them, and investigate
some of their more intriguing properties. The majority of information presented comes from
the text “Automatic Sequences: Theory, Applications, Generalisations” by Jean-Paul Allouche
and the University of Waterloo's own Jeffrey Shallit, from the department of Computer
Science.

The speaker has provided [a PDF
document](/assets/automatic-sequences.pdf) covering the same content as this talk.
