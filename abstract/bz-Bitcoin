In this talk, we will learn about the principles behind the Double Spend
Problem, the Blockchain, and explore the various ways this technology is being
used today.

Transferring money in the physical world is easy. However, the transfer of
virtual currency is not as easy to validate. The Double Spend Problem has long
stood in the way of a free (libre et gratis) virtual currency, and the world
found a need for a third party (usually in the form of large banks) to validate
all virtual transactions. 

In 2008, a mysterious individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper
titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" which describes a
system for virtual transactions to be validated through the distributed
computing power of the community. The system, known as the Blockchain, uses
hashing and non-deterministic mathematics to protect itself from Double
Spending attacks. Nakamoto's paper led to the creation of free online
currencies such Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, which are used in marketplaces
today.
