This talk will cover the very basics of Category Theory, motivated by simple
examples using the category of sets. I will then introduce some applications to
other areas of mathematics, such as linear algebra and programming language
theory.

## Outline

- Introduction (definition of categories - objects, morphisms, with composition and identity) 

- Examples with categories of sets (to illustrate compositions, retractions and sections, isomorphisms, other interesting morphisms, etc) 

- Notion of initial, terminal and zero objects 

- Categories of categories, locally small categories, functors (and some interesting ones), categorical equivalence 

- Applications - linear algebra 

- Applications - CS, Haskell, programming language theory
