This talk will cover the basics of group theory. There are no official
prerequisites for this talk, but MATH 145 and MATH 146 are an asset. The group
theory part of the talk will mostly be based on [Alekseev,
2004](http://mathcamp.org/2015/abel/abel.pdf), specifically sections 1.1
(motivation), 1.2 (transformation groups), 1.5, 1.9, and 1.13 (various
morphisms), and 1.11 (quotient groups).

Due to time constraints, it is inevitable that some content must be rushed. I
will not go over proofs and derivations in full rigour, and I highly advise
studying the reference material after the talk to catch up on what you may have
missed. Please message me in advance if there are any other subjects in
particular that you would like me to discuss.
