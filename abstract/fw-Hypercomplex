There are exactly three distinct two-dimensional unital algebras over the reals,
up to isomorphism. Each of these algebras corresponds to a unique geometry, with
applications. This talk will develop the concepts needed to understand
two-dimensional algebras over the reals, starting from the definitions of key
concepts. We will rediscover the familiar complex numbers and generalize its
construction to find the other hypercomplex number systems. We will then prove
the result that these are the unique hypercomplex number systems, up to
isomorphism. Finally, we will discuss possible generalizations to ``n``
dimensions. Please ensure that you have a good understanding of fundamental
concepts of [two-dimensional linear
algebra](/document/2d-linear-algebra).

We will use [Catoni, F., Cannata, R., Catoni, V., & Zampetti, P.
