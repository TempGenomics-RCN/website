## Geometry of complex numbers and the Quaternions

The main aim of this section is to study groups of linear transformations (the
orthogonal transformations) by representing them as matrix groups. The group of
all rotations on ``\mathbb{R}^2`` is denoted ``SO(2)``, for the "special
orthogonal" linear transformations from ``\mathbb{R}^2`` to ``\mathbb{R}^2``.
When represented as matrices, they have the property that their determinant is
1, and that ``AA^t=A^tA=I``, which also means that they admit a basis of
eigenvectors.

We consider the rotation matrix on ``\mathbb{R}^2``.

```math
R_θ =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(θ) & -\sin(θ) \\
\sin(θ) & \cos(θ)
\end{pmatrix}  = \cos(θ)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}  + \sin(θ)
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
```

Defining the first matrix to be ``\mathbf{1}``, and the second to be
``\mathbf{i}``, we get the regular identities fro complex numbers. We also see
that for any complex number ``z=a\mathbf{1}+b\mathbf{i}``, we can write

```math
z=\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}
```

and

```math
|z| = \det \begin{pmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix} = a^2+b^2 = |a+bi|
```

We can try a similar process over ``\mathbb{R}^4``, One thought is to associate
them with a ``2× 2`` matrix over ``\mathbb{C}``. We want all of the
matrices to rotate the vector ``(1,0)^t`` in orthogonal ways (under the
standard inner product on ``\mathbb{R}^n``)

```math
\begin{align*}
z
&=a\mathbf{1}+b\mathbf{i}+c\mathbf{j} + d\mathbf{k} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix}
a+di & -b-ci \\
b-ci & a-di
\end{pmatrix} \\
&= a\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} + b
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}  +c
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
-i & 0
\end{pmatrix}  +d
\begin{pmatrix}
i & 0 \\
0 & -i
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
```

Now, consider the purely imaginary quaternions ``\rho =
b\mathbf{i}+c\mathbf{j}+d\mathbf{k}``, which are the orthogonal compliments to
the real quaternions ``a\mathbf{1}``. For a purely imaginary product, we see
that

```math
\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}= \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}× \mathbf{v}
```

We notice that this product is algebraically closed when ``\mathbf{u}\cdot
\mathbf{v}=0``, meaning ``\mathbf{u}`` and ``\mathbf{v}`` are orthogonal. There
is some interesting matrix algebra related to the representation of complex
numbers, and the quaternions. Notice that if we take the conjugate of ``a+bi``
we get ``a-bi``, which has the matrix representation

```math
\overline{z}=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
-b & a
\end{pmatrix}
 = z^t
```

And for the quaternion conjugate
``\overline{z}=a\mathbf{1}-b\mathbf{i}-c\mathbf{j}-d\mathbf{k}``, we have

```math
\overline{z}=
\begin{pmatrix}
a-di & b+ci \\
-b+ci & a+di
\end{pmatrix} = z^{*}
```

This means that for quaternions (as they are not commutative)
``\overline{z_1z_2}=\bar{z_2}\bar{z_1}``. Consider unit quaternions in the form
``z=\cos(θ)+u\sin(θ)``, where ``u`` is a pure complex quaternion. A rotation
through the angle ``θ`` can be defined as ``t^{-1}zt``, where
``t=\cos(θ/2)+u\sin(θ)``. This is a rotation by theta through the axis ``u`` in
``\mathbb{R}^3``. The same rotation is induced by ``-t``, as
``(-t)^{-1}z(-t)=t^{-1}zt``. Thus rotations in ``\mathbb{R}^3`` are induced by
pairs of antipodal unit quaternions.

It is also useful to be able to talk about reflections in terms of quaternions
as well. A Reflection in the hyperplane ``O`` which is orthogonal to the unit
quaternion ``u`` is a map which sends each ``q∈ \mathbb{R}^4``  to
``-u\bar{q}u``. A linear map is called orientation preserving if its matrix
representation has a positive determinant, and orientation reversing otherwise.
Based on this map, reflections are orientation reversing. Rotations about ``O``
are orientation preserving isometries which fix ``O``. By the Cartan-Dieudonné
theorem, every rotation in an ``n`` dimensional symmetric bilinear space can be
represented by the product of at most n reflections. Since the determinant of a
reflection is negative, this shows that in ``\mathbb{R}^4`` every rotation is
the product of 0, 2, or 4 reflections. If the form of the reflection is
considered, it is easy to see that a rotation is a map ``q\mapsto vqw`` for
unit quaternions ``v,w``.

## Groups

The unit quaternions are usually denoted by the set ``\mathbb{S}^{3}``, as they
define a sphere in ``\mathbb{R}^4``. Each unit quaternion was shown to be
equivalent to the set of all complex matrices in the form

```math
Q= \begin{pmatrix}
a+di & -b-ci \\
b-ci & a-di
\end{pmatrix}  \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \textrm{where}  \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \det Q =1
```

This group is usually denoted ``\textrm{SU}(2)``, for the ``2× 2`` special
unitary matrices. The related group ``\textrm{SO}(3)``, or the group of all
rotations in ``\mathbb{R}^3``, is somewhat of a refinement on
``\textrm{SU}(2)``. Unit quaternions correspond to rotations of
``\mathbb{R}^3``, with antipodal pares of quaternions giving rise to the same
rotation in ``\mathbb{R}^3``. This suggests that it is possible to construct a
2-1 homomorphism from ``\textrm{SU}(2)`` to ``\textrm{SO}(3)``.

A useful property of groups is that many of them may be represented as a direct
product of groups ``A`` and ``B`` under the product of pairs operation
``(a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2,b_1,b_2)``. An example of this kind of group is
``\mathbb{R}^n`` with vector addition. Another interesting example is the group
of ``n× n`` matrices. If ``A,B∈ \mathbb{M}_{n× n}(\mathbb{F})``, then We can
write all elements in ``A× B`` in the form

```math
\begin{pmatrix}
a & \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{0} & b
\end{pmatrix}  \, \, \, \, \, \textrm{such that } a∈ A \, \, \, b∈ B
```

Since the elements of ``\mathbb{R}`` are isomorphic to the group of matrices

```math
\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
1 & x \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} :  \, \, \, \, \, x∈ \mathbb{R} \right\}
```

It follows that ``\mathbb{R}^n`` is isomorphic to a group of ``2n× 2n``
matrices. Replacing ``\mathbb{R}`` by ``\mathbb{S}^2`` gives a similar
isomorphism with ``θ`` in place for ``x``. The group ``\mathbb{S}^1×
\mathbb{S}^1`` is called the unit torus, as for ``θ, ϕ∈ \mathbb{S}^1``, we
can specify a point ``(θ, ϕ)`` which corresponds to a point on the surface
of the torus moving ``θ`` radians across along the outside edge, and ``ϕ``
along the inside edge. This group is denoted ``\mathbb{T}^2``  (figure 1).

``\mathbb{S}^2×\mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{T}^2``

Since ``\mathbb{R}`` and ``\mathbb{S}^1`` are abelian groups, their products
are abelian as well. It can be shown with some work that ``\mathbb{R}^m×
\mathbb{T}^n`` for ``m,n∈ \mathbb{N}`` include all connected abelian matrix Lie
groups. (Note that ``\mathbb{S}^n`` is not associated with a Cartesian product
the way that ``\mathbb{R}^n`` is, and ``\mathbb{T}^n\ncong\mathbb{S}^n``).

Now, we can try classifying rotations in ``\mathbb{R}^4`` (the group SO(4)) by
associating them with the group SU(2). Recall that all rotations can be
represented by the form ``q\mapsto vqw``, but since if ``v`` is a quaternion,
then ``v^{-1}`` exists, so there is no harm in defining the map to instead be
``q\mapsto v^{-1}qw``. With this in mind, consider the group ``\textrm{SU}(2)×
\textrm{SU}(2)``. There is a homomorphism from ``\textrm{SU}(2)×
\textrm{SU}(2)`` to ``\textrm{SO}(4)`` which takes ``(v,w)∈ \textrm{SU}(2)×
\textrm{SU}(2)`` to ``f(q)=v^{-1}qw``. We again encounter the antipodal pares
which produce the same rotation, so the homomorphism has a kernel of two
elements. It is possible to find a nontrivial subgroup of ``\textrm{SO}(4)``
which is normal by considering the image of the subgroup of points ``(v,1)`` in
``\textrm{SU}(2)× \textrm{SU}(2)``. This means that ``\textrm{SO}(4)`` is not
simple.

## Why are we talking about this?

In 1870, Sophus Lie was studying the symmetries of differential equations,
which generally form "continuous" groups. The analogous problem for polynomials
was solved by Galois previously, so there was incentive to solve the related
problem for these new kinds of groups. This lead to a study of simplicity in
these continuous groups. Lie understood these groups as groups generated by
infinitesimal elements, which lead him to believe that ``\textrm{SO}(n)``
should be generalised to consider infinitesimal rotations.  Today we separate
the infinitesimal rotations out into a group ``\mathfrak{so}(n)`` called the
**Lie Algebra** of ``\textrm{SO}(n)``.  Similarly, the infinitesimal elements
of a group G form a Lie algebra ``\mathfrak{g}``, which captures most of the
important structures of G, but is easier to handle. Using this notion of a
generalise group, Lie was able to prove simplicity for all but a finite number
of Lie algebras — namely those of the exceptional groups.
