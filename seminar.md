Welcome to the Temporal Genomics Seminar Series- a series of talks organized by the Temporal Genomics Working Group of the RCN-ECS.

These seminars run biweekly on Thursdays from 11:00-12:00 US Eastern time. Presenters will showcase a diverse set of studies using genomic data from the past and present to investigate questions relevant to ecology and evolutionary biology. We will also discuss best practices for conducting these studies and lessons learned while exploring this exciting new field.
