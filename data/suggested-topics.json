While often this is just a numerical coincidence, sometimes there is a clear mathematical reason for certain numbers to be almost integers. Pisot numbers, which are special types of algebraic integers, provide a systematic means to construct almost integers that approximate integers at an exponential rate. Of course, Pisot numbers are interesting on their own right and an interested speaker can also venture into the connections to Beta expansions (see the 2nd and 3rd references below), or fractals (see the 4th reference below).\n\n **Required Background:** Basic analysis at the level of 147 and 138, algebra at the level of 145. Any other background depends on the direction the speaker takes with this topic."

This idea was formalized by Hoare who developed *Hoare logic* as a means to prove program correctness. However, this technique didn't apply directly to concurrent programs. An alternative approach called *Temporal Logic* was proposed by Amir Pneuli in 1977 which did provide a means to reason about concurrent programs. This topic studies this and then delves into the fundamental ideas behind model checking.\n\n **Required Background:** Basics of computer science at the level of CS 146, Logic at the level of CS 245."

A special kind of very simple computer program that accepts or rejects strings, using only a finite number of states while reading the string, is called a deterministic finite automaton. (These deterministic finite automata can also be expressed as a regular expression.) For any two strings of length ``n``, there is some deterministic finite automaton (or regular expression) that recognizes one and not the other, and there is some smallest one. In the worst case, it is known (Robson 1989) that any two strings of length ``n`` can be separated by an automaton of size ``O(n^{2/5} (\\log n)^{3/5})``, but this is not known to be optimal. The optimal upper bound remains an open problem."

The angel has a power k (a natural number 1 or higher), specified before the game starts. The board starts empty with the angel at the origin. On each turn, the angel jumps to a different empty square which could be reached by at most k moves of a chess king, i.e. the distance from the starting square is at most k in the infinity norm. The devil, on its turn, may add a block on any single square not containing the angel. The angel may leap over blocked squares, but cannot land on them. The devil wins if the angel is unable to move. The angel wins by surviving indefinitely.\n\n The angel problem is: can an angel with high enough power win?\n\n **Required Background:** Basic analysis at the level of 147 and algebra at the level of 145.",
