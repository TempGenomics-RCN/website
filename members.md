I am broadly interested in finding genomic patterns across different geographic and time scales, and using this knowledge to better understand (1) how organisms adapt to their environment and (2) what are the factors that affect biodiversity in nature. Part of my current work is describing the anthropogenic effect on the genetic diversity of fish populations over more than 100 years of overfishing and habitat degradation in the Philippines.

PhD Candidate - [Earley Lab](https://rlearley.people.ua.edu/) - [University of Alabama](https://bsc.ua.edu/)

I am motivated by the question rather than the method. I employ methodologies from a wide range of fields and disciplines, including quantitative ecology, oceanography, biogeography, environmental DNA, and population genetics, to understand (i) how abiotic factors impact species distributions, (ii) the relative impact of biotic versus abiotic factors on local abundance, and (iii) how environmental factors between habitat patches impact connectivity. I currently explore these questions using _Kryptolebias marmoratus_, a small self-fertilizing hermaphroditic fish that inhabits New World mangrove forests.

### Brendan Reid
[Git](https://github.com/nerdbrained) [Website](https://nerdbrained.wixsite.com/home)

Postdoc - [Philippines PIRE Project](https://sites.wp.odu.edu/PIRE/); Pinsky Lab - [Rutgers University](https://pinsky.marine.rutgers.edu/)

I am interested in how genomics and evolutionary theory can inform ecology, conservation biology, and biodiversity management. My current work at Rutgers focuses on quantifying community-level patterns of genetic change in Philippine fish and evaluating methods for detecting recent population declines using temporal genomic data. In other ongoing and past work I have explored evolutionary potential in freshwater fish and patterns of genetic diversity in freshwater and marine turtles.

### Rene Clark
[Git](https://github.com/rclark848) [Website](https://www.clark-ecology.com/)

PhD Student - [Philippines PIRE Project](https://sites.wp.odu.edu/PIRE/); Pinsky Lab - [Rutgers University](https://pinsky.marine.rutgers.edu/)

I am currently a PhD candidate in Ecology & Evolution at Rutgers University, where my research interests include molecular ecology and marine conservation. Most of my ongoing work involves using population genomics tools and techniques to assess how marine populations are changing through both space and time, with emphasis on how we as humans are driving such processes around the globe. I am particularly interested in questions of adaptation and selection, as well as assessing the adaptive potential of tropical fish species.
