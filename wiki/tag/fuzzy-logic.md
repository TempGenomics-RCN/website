Fuzzy logic is an extension of Boolean logic by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965 based on the
mathematical theory of fuzzy sets, which is a generalization of the classical set theory. B
y introducing the notion of degree in the verification of a condition, thus enabling a
condition to be in a state other than true or false, fuzzy logic provides a very valuable
flexibility for reasoning, which makes it possible to take into account inaccuracies and
uncertainties.
