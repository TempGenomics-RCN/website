# Temporal Genomics Seminar Series

Welcome to the Temporal Genomics Seminar Series- a series of talks organized by the
Temporal Genomics Working Group of the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/).

These seminars run biweekly on Thursdays from 11:00-12:00 US Eastern time. Presenters
will showcase a diverse set of studies using genomic data from the past and present
to investigate questions relevant to ecology and evolutionary biology. We will also 
discuss best practices for conducting these studies and lessons learned while exploring
this exciting new field.

Each seminar is a 45 minute long talk. Check out our [archive](/archive/) to
