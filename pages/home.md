# UW Student Seminars

Welcome to the student-run University of Waterloo Student Seminars. These seminars run every
Wednesday (time TBD) and provide a platform for students to learn new topics and present
them to others.

Each seminar is a 45 minute long talk. Topics include those in our [list of suggested
topics](/potential-topics/) and other topics of interest to a general mathematics, computer
science, science, or other undergraduate audience. Check out our [archive](/archive/) to
look at past topics and summaries of past talks (or see the videos below). If you have any
questions for us, you can contact us by filling a form on our [FAQ page](/faq/) or
alternatively asking on our [Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/334849026859566/).

## Speak in Winter 2018

We are currently looking for speakers for Winter 2018. If you are interested in speaking
next term, please fill out our [talk proposal form](/submit-talk/). If you don’t have a
topic in mind, you can look at our [suggested topics](/potential-topics/), or browse for
topics by [tag](/tag/). Make sure you read through the [important information for
speakers](/important-information/) before signing up to speak. We organize dry runs before
the scheduled date of the talks, especially for first time speakers, to time the talk and to
help build confidence. If you need help with your talk, feel free to ask us for support — we
try to help our speakers as much as we can.
