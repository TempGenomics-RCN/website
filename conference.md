Presented by the Temporal Genomics Working Group, as part of the [Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/). 

Members of the RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas and the ecology & evolution community at large are invited to participate in a Twitter symposium during the first full week in July 2021. This Twitter symposium  is aimed specifically at researchers interested in, or currently utilizing, temporal genomics methods and practices. 

**This Twitter symposium will provide:** 
* An opportunity for scientists (particularly those early in their career) to share their work with a broader community in an informal setting.
* An opportunity for presenters and attendees to network and interact with the public and other researchers.
* Increased visibility for the field of temporal genomics.

**Presentation style:** 
* Participants in the Temporal Genomics Twitter Symposium are invited to condense their current research into a ~5-7 tweet thread (1,400-1,960 characters).
* Each presenter will be given thirty minutes (15 minutes for presentation tweets and a 15 minute "live" Q&A session).

**Presentation guidelines:**
* Tweets for each presentation must belong to one thread.
* Tweets can be text, contain slides/graphics, or a combination of both.
* Tweets should be spaced out over the course of the 15 minute presentation period (no faster than ~1 tweet/minute).
* The first tweet in the thread **must** contain the symposium hashtag: **#TempGen2021Tweets** as well as the title of your presentation.
* Participants should remain available on Twitter for an additional 15 minutes after their presentation, to answer any questions or comments.

The symposium will be moderated by the RCN for Evolution in Changing Sea's Twitter account (**@evolvingseas**). To catch all the action, be sure to follow the RCN Twitter account and/or the symposium hashtag (**#TempGen2021Tweets**). @evolvingseas will tweet out the symposium schedule, introduce each presenter at the time of their presentation, and retweet the first tweet in each presentation thread.

*Parts of this page are based largely on the wonderful advice and guidance of the [Beyond 150 Twitter conference](https://beyond150ca.wordpress.com/presenters-guide/) and [#ASEH2018Tweets](https://jessicamdewitt.com/2018/02/12/aseh2018tweets-presenters-guide/). A large thank you to Andrea Eidinger, Krista McCracken, and Jessica M. DeWitt for putting those together!*
