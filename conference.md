# Temporal Genomics Twitter Symposium 

#TempGen2021Tweets 

**Twitter Symposium Date: July 8, 2021 9 AM - 2 PM EDT** 

Presented by the Temporal Genomics Working Group, as part of the [Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/). 

Members of the RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas and the ecology & evolution community at large are invited to participate in a Twitter symposium during the first full week in July 2021. This Twitter symposium  is aimed specifically at researchers interested in, or currently utilizing, temporal genomics methods and practices. 

**This Twitter symposium will provide:** 
* An opportunity for scientists (particularly those early in their career) to share their work with a broader community in an informal setting.
* An opportunity for presenters and attendees to network and interact with the public and other researchers.
* Increased visibility for the field of temporal genomics.

**Presentation style:** 
* Participants in the Temporal Genomics Twitter Symposium are invited to condense their current research into a ~5-7 tweet thread (1,400-1,960 characters).
* Each presenter will be given thirty minutes (15 minutes for presentation tweets and a 15 minute "live" Q&A session).

**Presentation guidelines:**
* Tweets for each presentation must belong to one thread.
* Tweets can be text, contain slides/graphics, or a combination of both.
* Tweets should be spaced out over the course of the 15 minute presentation period (no faster than ~1 tweet/minute).
* The first tweet in the thread **must** contain the symposium hashtag: **#TempGen2021Tweets** as well as the title of your presentation.
* Participants should remain available on Twitter for an additional 15 minutes after their presentation, to answer any questions or comments.

**Schedule of presenters will be posted here prior to the symposium!**
