Call for Participants 

**Abstract Deadline: Monday, June 7, 2021 (11:59 PM Eastern Time)** 

**Twitter Conference Dates: July 7-9, 2021** 

Presented by the Temporal Genomics Working Group, as part of the [Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/). 

Members of the RCN for Evolution in Changing Seas and the ecology & evolution community at large are invited to participate in a Twitter conference during the first full week in July 2021. This Twitter conference is aimed specifically at researchers interested in, or currently utilizing, temporal genomics methods and practices. 

**This Twitter conference will provide:** 
* An opportunity for scientists (particularly those early in their career) to share their work with a broader community in an informal setting.
* An opportunity for presenters and attendees to network and interact with the public and other researchers.
* Increased visibility for the field of temporal genomics.

**Presentation style:** 
* Participants in the Temporal Genomics Twitter Conference are invited to condense their current research into a ~5-7 tweet thread (1,400-1,960 characters).
* Each presenter will be given thirty minutes (15 minutes for presentation tweets and a 15 minute "live" Q&A session).

**If you are interested in presenting, please use this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/GPgAayoWPtYSvNa89) to submit your presentation title, a 200-word abstract, and other accompanying information.**
