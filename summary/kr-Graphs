## Simplexes

### Definitions

Let ``v^0,\dots,v^n`` be ``n+1`` vectors in ``\euc{N},n\geq 1``. They are
called **affinely linearly independent** if ``v^1 - v^0,\dots,v^n - v^0`` are
linearly independent. By convention if ``n= 0`` then ``v^0`` is affinely
linearly independent even if its 0.

Let ``v^0,\dots,v^n`` be vectors in ``\euc{N}``. A vector ``v`` is said to be
**affinely dependent** on them if there exist real numbers
``\lambda_0,\dots,\lambda_n`` such that

```math
\lambda_1 + \dots + \lambda_n = 1 \textrm { and } v = \lambda_0v^0 + \dots
\lambda_nv^n
```

Let ``v^0,\dots,v^n`` be a-independent. The **(closed) simplex** with vertices
``v^0,\dots,v^n`` is the set of points a-dependent on ``v^0,\dots,v^n`` and
with every barycentric coordinate greater than or equal to 0. The simplex is
said to be **spanned** by ``v^0,\dots,v^n``. The points with barycentric
coordinate greater than 0 are said to be the **interior** of the simplex, and
the set of interior points is sometimes called the **open simplex** with
vertices ``v^0,\dots,v^n``. The **boundary** of the simplex consists of those
points which are not interior. We denote a (closed) simplex with a-indepenent
vertices ``v^0,\dots,v^n`` by ``(v^0\dots v^n)`` and often represent it by a
symbol ``s_n`` or just ``s``. The integer ``n`` is called the **dimension** of
``(v^0 \dots v^n)``. A simplex of dimension ``n`` is called an ``n``-simplex.

Let ``s_n = (v^1 \dots v^n)`` be a simplex. A **face** of ``s_n`` is a simplex
whose vertices form a (non-empty) subset of ``\{v^0,\dots,v^n\}``. If the
subset is proper we say the face is a **proper face**. If ``s_p`` is a face of
``s_n`` we write ``s_p < s_n`` or ``s_n > s_p``. Note ``s_n < s_n`` for any
simplex ``s_n``.

### Ordered and Oriented Simplexes

Let ``s_n = (v^0 \dots v^n)`` be a simplex. An **orientation** for ``s_n`` is a
collection of orderings for the vertices consisting of a particular ordering
and all even permuations of it. An **oriented n-simplex** ``\sigma_n`` is an
``n``-simplex ``s_n``, together with an orientation for ``s_n``.

We write ``\sigma_n = (v^0 \dots v^n)`` to mean ``\sigma_n`` is the oriented
``n``-simplex with vertices ``(v^0,\dots,v^n)`` and orientation given by the
ordering displayed and all even permutations of it. It will always be clear
from the context wether ``(v^0 \dots v^n)`` means simplex or orientated
simplex. When ``n > 0`` we write ``-\sigma_n`` for the oriented simplex
consisting of the same ``n``-simplex and the collection of other possible
orderings of the vertices. Thus by definition ``-(-\sigma_n) = \sigma_n``.

### Simplical Complexes

A **simplical complex** is a finite set ``K`` of simplexes in ``\euc{N}`` with
the following two properties:

	- if ``s \in K`` and ``t < s`` (``t`` is a face of ``s``) then ``t \in s``

	- intersection condition: if ``s \in K`` and ``t \in K`` then ``s \cap t`` is
	  either empty or else a face of both ``s`` and ``t``

The **dimension** of ``K`` is the largest dimension of any simplex in ``K``.
The **underlying space** of ``K``, denoted ``\abs{K}``, is the set of points in
``\euc{N}`` which belong to at least one simplex of ``K``.

A **subcomplex** of a simplical complex ``K`` is a subset ``L`` of ``K`` which
is itself a simplical complex. (This is if and only if ``L`` has the property
that)

```math
s \in L \land t < s \Rightarrow t \in L
```

The subcomplex is called **proper** if ``L \neq K``.

An **oriented simplical complex** is a simplical complex in which every simplex
is provided an orientation.

### Abstract Simplicial Complexes

An **abstract simplical complex** is a pair ``X = (V,S)`` where ``V`` is a
finite set whose elements are called the **vertices** of ``X`` and ``S`` is a
set of non-empty subsets of ``V``. Each element ``s \in S`` is called a
**simplex** of ``X`` and if ``s \in S`` has precisely ``n+1`` elements, ``s``
is called an ``n``-simplex. ``S`` is required to statisfy the following two
conditions

 1. ``v \in V \Rightarrow \{v\} \in S ``
 2. ``s \in S, t\subset s \Rightarrow t \in S``

The **dimension** of ``X`` is so long as ``V \neq \emptyset`` the largest ``n``
for which ``S`` contains an ``n``-simplex.

Two abstract simplical complexes ``X = (V,S), X' = (V',S')`` are said to be
**isomorphic** if there is a bijection ``f: V \rightarrow V'`` with the
property that

```math
\{v^0,\dots,v^n\} \in S \Leftrightarrow \{f(x^0),\dots,f(x^n)\} \in S'
```

A **realization** of an abstract simplical complex ``X`` is a simplical complex
whose corresponding abstract simplical complex is isomorphic to ``X``.

**Theorem**: Every abstract simplical complex of dimension ``n`` has a
realization in ``\euc{2n + 1}``.

### Chain Groups and Boundary Homomorphisms

Let ``K`` be an oriented simplical complex of dimension ``n``, and let
``\alpha_p`` be the number of ``p``-simplexes of ``K``. For ``0 \leq p \leq n``
let ``\sigma_p^1,\dots,\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}`` be the oriented ``p``-simplexes of
``K``; for such ``p`` the ``p``th chain group of ``K``, denoted ``C_p(K)`` is
the free abelian group on the set ``\{\sigma_p^1,\dots,\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}\}``.
Thus an element of ``C_p(K)`` is a linear combination

```math
\lambda_1\sigma_p^1 + \dots + \lambda_{\alpha_p}\sigma_p^{\alpha_p}
```

with ``\lambda``'s integers. This is called a ``p``-chain on ``K`` and two
``p``-chains are added by adding the corresponding coefficients. When writing
down ``p``-chains it is customary to omit ``p``-simplexes whose coefficient is
zero, unless they are all zero, in which case we write 0.

Let ``\sigma = (v^0 \dots v^p)`` be an oriented ``p``-simplex of ``K`` for some
``p > 0``. The **boundary** of ``\sigma`` is the ``(p-1)``-chain

```math
\partial \sigma = \partial_p \sigma = \sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^i(v_0 \dots \hat{v^i}
\dots v^p)
```

For ``p = 0`` the boundary is defined to be 0. The **boundary homomorphism**
``\partial = \partial_p : C_p(K) \rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)`` is defined by

```math
\partial_p(\Sigma\lambda_i\sigma_p^i) = \Sigma\lambda_i\partial_p(\sigma_p^i)
```

for ``0 \leq p \leq n`` and is defined to be the trivial homomorphism
otherwise.

The **augmentation**

```math
\epsilon : C_0(K) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}
```

is the homomorphism defined by

```math
\epsilon(\Sigma\lambda_i\sigma_0^i) = \Sigma\lambda_i
```

the sequences

```math
\dots 0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow C_n(K) \xrightarrow{\partial} C_{n-1}(K)
\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow C_1(K) \xrightarrow{\partial} C_0(K) \rightarrow
0 \rightarrow 0 \dots
```

and

```math
\dots 0 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow C_n(K) \xrightarrow{\partial} C_{n-1}(K)
\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow C_1(K) \xrightarrow{\partial} C_0(K)
\xrightarrow{\epsilon} \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0 \dots
```

are called the **chain complex** of ``K`` and the **augmented chain complex**
of ``K``, respectively.

**Proposition**: For any ``p``, the homomorphism

```math
\partial \circ \partial = \partial_{p-1}\circ \partial_p : C_p(K) \rightarrow
C_{p-2}(K)
```

is trivial. Also ``\epsilon \circ \partial_1:C_1(K) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}`` is
trivial.

**Corollary**: For any ``p``

```math
\Ima \partial_{p+1} \subset \Ker \partial_p
```

and also

```math
\Ima \partial_p \subset \Ker \epsilon
```

### Homology Groups

Consider the sequence

```math
C_{p+1}(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_{p+1}} C_p(K) \xrightarrow{\partial_p}
\rightarrow C_{p-1}(K)
```

``\Ker \partial_p`` is denoted by ``Z_p`` or ``Z_p(K)`` and the elements of
``Z_p`` are called ``p``-cycles. ``Z_p`` is a free, finitely generated group.
``\Ima \partial_{p+1}`` is denoted by ``B_p`` or ``B_p(K)`` and the elements of
``B_p`` are called ``p``-boundaries. ``B_p`` is a free finitely generated
group.

Since ``B_p \subset Z_p`` there is a quotient group ``H_p(K) = Z_p / B_p(K)``
called the ``p``th **homology group** of ``K``.

The quotient group ``\Ker \epsilon / B_0(K)`` is denoted ``\tilde{H}_0(K)`` and
is called the **reduced zeroth homology group** of ``K``.

An element of ``H_p(K)`` is a coset ``\bar{z} = z + B_p(K)`` where ``z \in
Z_p(K)``. We use the notation ``\{z\}`` for this coset. It is called the
**homology class** of the cycle ``z``. Any cycle ``z' \in \{z\}`` is called a
**representative cycle** for ``\{z\}``. We say that ``z`` and ``z'`` are
**homologous** if ``z - z' \in B_p(K)`` and write ``z \sim z'``

**Proposition**: ``v \sim v'`` if and only ``v`` and ``v'`` lie in the same
connected component of ``K``

**Proposition**: Let ``K`` be a non-empty oriented simplical complex with ``k``
components ``K_1,\dots,K_k`` and let ``v^i`` be a vertex in ``K_i``. Then
``H_0(K)`` is freely generated by the homology class ``\{v^i\}`` for ``i =
1,\dots,k``. Thus ``H_0(K) \simeq \mathbb{Z}^k``.

``H_0(K) \cong \mathbb{Z}^k`` where ``k`` is the number of connected components
of ``K``.
