We use natural numbers for two things. For ordering things and for measuring
the size of a set. Ordinals generalize natural numbers but also work for
infinite sets.

Let's talk about well-ordered sets first.

**Definition**. Let ``<`` be a binary relation on  set ``A``. We say that ``(A, <)``
is a strict total-ordering if the following two conditions hold.

  - For every ``x,y \in A`` we have exactly one of ``x < y`` or ``x = y`` or ``y < x``.
  - For all ``x,y,z \in A`` we have that if ``x < y`` and ``y < x`` then ``x < z``.

A totally ordered set ``(A, <)`` is well ordered if every non-empty subset of
``A`` has a smallest element with respect to ``<``. \end{defn}

We define the natural numbers as follows. Let ``0 := \varnothing``, and ``n := (n -
1) \cup \{n - 1\}`` for non-zero natural numbers. But this is circular because
we don't have induction yet. So for this, we need the axiom of induction. This
says the following.

**Axiom of Infinity**
There is a set ``I`` such that ``\varnothing \in I`` and for every ``x \in I`` we
have ``S(x) \in I`` where ``S(x) = x \cup \{x\}``.

Define ``\omega`` to be the smallest subset of ``I`` that satisfies this
property (call any set that satisfies this property _inductive_). Formally
this is the following:

```math
\omega = \bigcap \Big\{J \subseteq I : 0 \in J, \text{
for all x } \in \text{ J we have } S(x) \in J\Big\}.
```

``\omega`` is the formal definition of the natural numbers.

Here is a theorem that is our first result.

**Theorem**.
``(\omega, \in)`` is a strict well order and for every ``n \in \omega``, ``(n,
\in) `` is also a strict well order.

Here is a lemma that we will need.

**Lemma**.
Let ``n \in \omega``. Then either ``0 = n`` or ``0 \in n``.

Proof: Observe that ``J = \{0\} \cup \{n \in \omega : 0 in n\} \subseteq
\omega`` and is inductive.

Now let's prove the first part of our theorem.

Suppose that ``X \subseteq \omega`` has no least element and ``X \subseteq \omega``. Let

```math
J = \{n \in \omega : S(n) \cap X = \varnothing\}.
```

Since ``X`` has no least element we cannot have ``0 \in X``. Hence ``S(0) \cap
X = \varnothing`` and this means that ``0 \in J``. Now suppose that ``n \in J``
which means ``S(n) \cap X = \varnothing``. Now ``S(n) \not in X`` because it would
be least. Hence ``S(S(n)) \cap X = \varnothing `` so ``S(n) \in J``.

Now here's an important theorem we will not prove.

**Proposition**.
Every element of ``\omega`` is a subset of ``\omega``.

Using this we can finally define an ordinal.

An **ordinal** is a set satisfying the following two properties.

  - ``(\alpha, \in) `` is a strict well-ordering
  - Every element of ``\alpha`` is a subset of ``\alpha``.

Observe that subsets of ordinals are not always ordinals as ``\{\{0\}\}
\subseteq 2`` but ``\{\{0\}\} \not\in 2``. However we have the following
result.

**Proposition**.
If ``\alpha, \beta`` are ordinals with ``\alpha \neq \beta`` and ``\alpha
\subseteq \beta`` then ``\alpha \in \beta``.

We have a very cool result for ordinals that we will not prove here.

**Proposition**.
Let ``\alpha, \beta`` be ordinals. Then either ``\alpha \in \beta``, ``\alpha =
\beta`` or ``\beta \in \alpha``.

Let ``E`` be a set of ordinals. Let ``X = \bigcup E``. Then ``X`` is an
ordinal. [Exercise] You can check that ``\sup E`` is the least upper bound of
``E`` where ``< `` is membership.

We can state the principle of transfinite induction as follows.

**Proposition: Transfinite Induction**.
Suppose that ``P(x)`` is a well-formed statement about an ordinal ``x``. Suppose

  - P(0) is true.

  - If ``P(\alpha)`` is true for some ordinal ``\alpha`` then ``P(S(\alpha))`` is true.

  - If ``\alpha`` is a limit ordinal and ``\alpha > 0`` then ``P(\beta)`` is
    true for all ``\beta < \alpha`` then ``P(\alpha)`` is true.

Since we don't have time we will explain transfinite recursion by using it to
define ordinal addition.

**Definition**.
Let ``\beta`` be an ordinal. First define ``\beta + 0 = \beta``. Then for an
ordinal ``\alpha`` define ``\beta + S(\alpha) = S(\beta + \alpha)``. Lastly if
``\alpha`` is a limit ordinal (an ordinal that is not a successor ordinal i.e
not of the form ``S(x)`` for any ordinal ``x``) then define

```math
\beta + \alpha = \sup\{\beta + \gamma : \gamma > \alpha\}.
```

Here is a huge theorem.

**Proposition**.
Let ``(A, <)`` be any strict well ordering. Then there is a unique ordinal
``\alpha`` such that ``(A, <) `` is isomorphic to ``(\alpha, \in)`` as an
ordering (please google/ask what an isomorphism of orderings is).

Hence if we have the axiom of choice, then every set is well-orderable. Hence
we can define the notion of a _cardinal_ for any set.

**Definition**.
An ordinal ``\alpha`` is a cardinal if there is no ordinal ``\beta < \alpha``
such that there is a bijection ``f : \beta \to \alpha``.

So the axiom of choice guarantees that there is a cardinal for every set.

Okay that's enough math. Let's talk about the Philosophy of infinity.

A finitist will deny infinite mathematics. But an ultrafinitist denies the
mathematics of very large numbers. Read Harvey M Friedman's
[account](https://dialinf.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/achilles-tortoise-and-yessenin-volpin/)
on meeting an ultrafinitist "Philosophical Problems in Logic".

> I have seen some ultrafinitists go so far as to challenge the existence of
``2^{100}`` as a natural number, in the sense of there being a series of
“points” of that length. There is the obvious “draw the line” objection, asking
where in ``2^1``, ``2^2``, ``2^3``, ... , ``2^{100}`` do we stop having
“Platonistic reality”? Here this … is totally innocent, in that it can be
easily be replaced by ``100`` items (names) separated by commas. I raised just
this objection with the (extreme) ultrafinitist Yessenin-Volpin during a
lecture of his. He asked me to be more specific. I then proceeded to start with
``2^1`` and asked him whether this is “real” or something to that effect. He
virtually immediately said yes. Then I asked about ``2^2``, and he again said
yes, but with a perceptible delay. Then ``2^3``, and yes, but with more delay.
This continued for a couple of more times, till it was obvious how he was
handling this objection. Sure, he was prepared to always answer yes, but he was
going to take ``2^{100}`` times as long to answer yes to ``2^{100}`` then he
would to answering ``2^1``. There is no way that I could get very far with
this.
