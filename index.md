# Temporal Genomics Working Group

Our working group was funded in 2021 by the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/)
to review best practices on using genetic data from multiple time points in
ecological and evolutionary research. Thanks for checking us out!

We will be hosting a [seminar series](https://tempgenomics-rcn.github.io/website/seminar) in 2021. Click the link for a schedule.
