# TempGenomics-RCN

WELCOME!!! 


## About

Our working group was funded in 2021 by the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/)
to review best practices on using genetic data from multiple time points in
ecological and evolutionary research. Thanks for checking us out!


## Lecture Series

We will be hostng a series of seminars on various topics relevant to temporal genomics given by prominent and early-career scientist in the field.

These seminars run biweekly on Thursdays from 11:00-12:00 US Eastern time. Presenters will showcase a diverse set of studies using genomic data from the past and present to investigate questions relevant to ecology and evolutionary biology. We will also discuss best practices for conducting these studies and lessons learned while exploring this exciting new field.

Everyone is welcome to join! 

Please consider supporting our group by filling up a quick registration form [here](google.form) (google form will be up shortly).

I am broadly interested in finding genomic patterns across different geographic and time scales, and using this knowledge to better understand (1) how organisms adapt to their environment and (2) what are the factors that affect biodiversity in nature. Part of my current work is describing the anthropogenic effect on the genetic diversity of fish populations over more than 100 years of overfishing and habitat degradation in the Philippines
