# Temporal Genomics Working Group

WELCOME :slightly_smiling_face:

## About

Our working group was funded in 2021 by the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/)
to review best practices on using genetic data from multiple time points in
ecological and evolutionary research. Thanks for checking us out!

## Lecture Series

We will be hostng a series of seminars on various topics relevant to temporal genomics given by prominent and early-career scientist in the field

These seminars run biweekly on Thursdays from 11:00-12:00 US Eastern time. Presenters will showcase a diverse set of studies using genomic data from the past and present to investigate questions relevant to ecology and evolutionary biology. We will also discuss best practices for conducting these studies and lessons learned while exploring this exciting new field.

Everyone is welcome to join!
