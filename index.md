# TempGenomics-RCN

WELCOME!!! 


## About

Our working group was funded in 2021 by the [RCN-ECS](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/)
to review best practices on using genetic data from multiple time points in
ecological and evolutionary research. Thanks for checking us out!


## Lecture Series

We will be hosting a series of seminars on various topics relevant to temporal genomics given by prominent and early-career scientists in the field.

These seminars run biweekly, usually on Thursdays from 11:00-12:00 US Eastern time. Presenters will showcase a diverse set of studies using genomic data from the past and present to investigate questions relevant to ecology and evolutionary biology. We will also discuss best practices for conducting these studies and lessons learned while exploring this exciting new field.

Everyone is welcome to join!
